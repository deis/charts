  WARNING: this chart is for testing only!  It tracks the latest build of the Deis Router. 
  component.  Features may not work and there are likely to be bugs.

  The Deis Router is a simple program that manages Nginx and Nginx configuration for managing
  ingress to web applications in a Kubernetes cluster without requiring each to have their own
  external (to the cluster) load balancer.  Router(s) will require a single external load balancer,
  handle all ingress, and direct all incoming traffic to appropriate services within the cluster.  
  
  Router works by regularly querying the Kubernetes API for services labeled with `routable:
  "true"`. Such services are compared to known services resident in memory. If there are
  differences, new Nginx configuration is generated and Nginx is reloaded.
