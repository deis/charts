## Work in Progress

Deis v2 and Helm are changing quickly. Your feedback and participation are more than welcome, but be aware that this project is considered a work in progress.

## Contributing

Hacking on Deis v2 is a bit rough right now--please help us fix the bugs and improve the installation process.

First, add this Chart repo to Helm to install the "deis" chart:
```console
$ helm add repo deis https://github.com/deis/charts
$ helm up
$ helm fetch deis/deis
$ helm install deis
$ kubectl get pods  # repeat this until deis-workflow is "Running"
$ kubectl get service deis-workflow  # note the IP address for later
```

Then open an SSH session to a Kubernetes minion node, install the `deis` client, and register:

```console
$ curl -sSL http://deis.io/deis-cli/install.sh | sh
$ mkdir $HOME/bin && mv deis $HOME/bin
$ deis register 10.247.59.157:8000  # or the appropriate CLUSTER_IP, from above
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@deis.com"
$ eval $(ssh-agent) && ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
$ deis keys:add ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
$ deis create --no-remote
Creating Application... done, created madras-radiator
$ deis pull deis/example-go -a madras-radiator
Creating build... ..o
```
