  WARNING: this chart is for testing only!  It tracks the latest builds of every
  constituent component.  Features may not work, the components are not HA, and there are likely
  to be bugs.

  Deis (pronounced DAY-iss) is an open source PaaS that makes it easy to deploy
  and manage applications on your own servers. Deis builds on Kubernetes
  to provide a lightweight, Heroku-inspired workflow.
