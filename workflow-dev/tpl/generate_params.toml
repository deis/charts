# This is the main configuration file for Deis object storage. The values in
# this file are passed into the appropriate services so that they can configure
# themselves for persisting data in object storage.
#
# In general, all object storage credentials must be able to read and write to
# the container or bucket they are configured to use.
#
# When you change values in this file, make sure to re-run `helmc generate`
# on this chart.

# Set the storage backend
#
# Valid values are:
# - s3: Store persistent data in AWS S3 (configure in S3 section)
# - azure: Store persistent data in Azure's object storage
# - gcs: Store persistent data in Google Cloud Storage
# - minio: Store persistent data on in-cluster Minio server
