  The Deis Router is a simple program that manages Nginx and Nginx configuration for managing
  ingress to web applications in a Kubernetes cluster without requiring each to have their own
  external (to the cluster) load balancer.  Router(s) will require a single external load balancer,
  handle all ingress, and direct all incoming traffic to appropriate services within the cluster.

  Router works by regularly querying the Kubernetes API for services labeled with
  `router.deis.io/routable: "true"`. Such services are compared to known services resident in
  memory. If there are differences, new Nginx configuration is generated and Nginx is reloaded.
