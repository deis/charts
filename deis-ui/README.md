# Deis UI

Deis UI is a full client-side web application that interfaces with the Deis API. It is installed
into the deis namespace and communicates using the deis-worflow service. It also has certain
annotations to "hack" itself into Deis' router as an external application.

Ensure that you've installed either the deis or deis-dev charts before installing this chart,
then go to www.$DEIS_DOMAIN in a browser to log into Deis.
